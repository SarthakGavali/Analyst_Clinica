# Analyst_Clinica: Preparing for the Influenza season. 
This Analytics Project analyzes some Seasonal, Geographical and Demographic trends in Influenza and comes up insights that will help the Healthcare system to manage their resources efficiently.

## Goal:
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza
season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for
staffing needs across the country.

## Requirements:
● Provide information to support a staffing plan, detailing what data can help inform the timing and spatial distribution of medical personnel throughout the United States.
● Determine whether influenza occurs seasonally or throughout the entire year. If seasonal,does it start and end at the same time (month) in every state?
● Prioritize states with large vulnerable populations. Consider categorizing each state as low-,medium-, or high-need based on its vulnerable population count.
● Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analyses.

## DATASETS:
1. Influenza deaths by geography, time, age, and gender

 ### NOTE: This is student project and the data is open source data. keep in mind that these numbers are estimates, hence the sum of the numbers from the different age groups may not sum up to the total in the first columns, but that’s totally okay.
